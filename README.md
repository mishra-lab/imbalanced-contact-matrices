## Descsription of Study

**Research Question:** How do imbalanced contact matrices from age-stratified populations bias tranmsission dynamics of infectious diseases?

**Research Aims:** 
1. Assess the effect of imbalanced contact matrices on the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease across 177 demographic settings 
2. Construct a theoretical susceptible exposed infected recovered tranmission model of SARS-CoV-2 stratified by age, to assess the effect of imbalanced contact matrices on infection transmission dynamics
3. Simulate age-specific vaccination strategies within the SEIR model to assess the effect of imbalanced contact matrices on impact of targeted public health interventions


## Description of Repository

2. **Data:** Data used to run code
3. **Figures:** Figures output from Results.R
4. **Output:** Data output from Main.R
